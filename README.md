# PiPlanter
Repository of pi + arudino code required for the NGTB PiPlanter project.

Trying out gitHub for the first time. Hopefully this will b a helpful tool in collaberating with Sean on the PiPlanter project. 
Will add useful files as the project continues.

Leaving for the summer. Attempting to leaves some notes to help kickstart this project in the fall/help the next person to work on this. 

Things to do:
1. Graph data
  a. A few test examples in PiPlanter/Code. Plotly is cool, but not sure if we can easily export those graphs as .jpgs or anything through      code. MatPlotLib looks promising, but it is unfinished. Read through documentation online.
  b. Examples are set up using data pulled from the MySQL Server. The MySWQLTest file will set up some datapoint in a database                  TestPiPlanter_DB, but requires some knowledge of MySQL if you want to edit. Sorry. 
2. Better Sensors
  a. Current sensors corroded very quickly, leaving us with very poor data. Use Galvanized wire / brass nails and find something that            doesn't corrode in water. 
3. Work on pumps
  a. Currently, there are no pumps.solenoid to work on, though those will have to be played around with and tested before using.
4. Keep on analysing Code_Original and use it to base new on.
